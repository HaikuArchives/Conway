This is another implementation of Conway's Game of Life (a simple but fascinating artificial-life simulation).  Conway differs from the "Life" program included with BeOS in two ways: first, it runs in a window, not full-screen, so you can keep it open in the background; and second, it provides a "delta" display showing how the board has 
changed over time. I think the combination of the current board and delta displays is kind of fun to watch (even hypnotic if you're in the mood).
